LL living lab network project is an online visual tool that presents the evolution of
the different Tanzanian LLs as well as their goals, objectives, challenges and
programmes. It allows its members to focus on their objectives and gather ideas
from others. It is also a tool for funders to evaluate the effectiveness of the LLs in
using funds and attain sustainability.
